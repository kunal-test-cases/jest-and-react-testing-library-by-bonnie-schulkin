# Why not mock axios using Jest?

There are several reasons to use Mock Service Worker over mocking axios:

1. For this app, we make two requests at the same time (scoops and toppings on the options page), and it would be difficult to manage that with mock return values -- as well as brittle: if you re-arrange your page then your tests could fail because your return values were in the wrong order on your mock.

2. You may want to return values based on, say, the POST data of the request. MSW allows for this with the handler functions.

3. MSW can handle sophisticated aspects of requests such as cookies and binary responses like images.

4. You may decide to switch the method you use to make server requests (fetch to axios, say), and MSW will work regardless of the method you use.

tl;dr: for simple apps, mocking could work, but MSW provides lots of tools for more complicated apps.
